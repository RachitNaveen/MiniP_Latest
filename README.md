## üß† How It Works

The AI-based Multi-Factor Authentication system works as follows:

1. **Risk Assessment**: When a user attempts to log in, the system evaluates various risk factors:
   - Recent failed login attempts
   - Login location/IP address analysis
   - Time-of-day risk evaluation
   - Account activity patterns
   - Device fingerprinting

2. **Security Level Determination**: Based on the calculated risk score, the system assigns one of three security levels:
   - **Low Risk (Level 1)**: Only password required
   - **Medium Risk (Level 2)**: Password + CAPTCHA required
   - **High Risk (Level 3)**: Password + CAPTCHA + Face Verification required

3. **Transparent Security**: The system shows users why certain security measures are being required by displaying:
   - Overall risk score
   - Security level explanation
   - Breakdown of individual risk factors
   - Descriptive explanations of detected risks

## üì¶ Requirements

**For Local Development:**
- Python 3.9+ (recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment tool (recommended)
- CMake (for dlib/face_recognition installation)
- Face-API.js models

**For Docker Deployment:**
- Docker Desktop installed and running

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Method 1: Local Setup (using Python Virtual Environment)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securechat.git
   cd securechat  # Or your project directory name (minip_latest)
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Common Installation Issues:**
   - For face_recognition/dlib installation errors:
     - On macOS: `brew install cmake`
     - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y cmake`
     - On Windows: Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
   - For pkg_resources errors: `pip install --upgrade setuptools`

4. **Download Face-API.js models:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p app/static/face-api-models
   ```
   
   Download the model weights from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights
   
   Required model files:
   - face_landmark_68_model-shard1
   - face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
   - face_recognition_model-shard1
   - face_recognition_model-shard2
   - face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
   - tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
   - tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
   
   Place all downloaded files in the `app/static/face-api-models/` directory.

5. **Initialize the database and apply migrations:**
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   flask db upgrade
   ```
   This will create the necessary database tables and apply all migrations.

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Method 2: Docker Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securechat.git
   cd securechat  # Or your project directory name (minip_latest)
   ```

2. **Download Face-API.js models:**
   Follow step 4 from the Local Setup instructions to download the required model files and place them in `app/static/face-api-models/`.

3. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t securechat-app .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -v "$(pwd)/instance":/app/instance --name securechat-container securechat-app
   ```
   - `-p 5000:5000`: Maps port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container.
   - `-v "$(pwd)/instance":/app/instance`: Mounts the local `instance` directory for database persistence.
   - `--name securechat-container`: Assigns a name to the running container.

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Build and Run the Application with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t securechat .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/instance:/app/instance securechat
   ```

   - `-p 5000:5000`: Maps port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container.
   - `-v $(pwd)/instance:/app/instance`: Mounts the `instance` directory for persistent data storage.

3. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # If using local setup
   python run.py
   
   # If using Docker, the application starts automatically after running the container
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Register a new user:**
   - Click "Register" and fill in the form
   - Create a username and password (must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character)
   - Complete the CAPTCHA verification
   - Allow camera access for face verification setup (if prompted)

4. **Log in with your credentials:**
   - Enter your username and password
   - Complete any additional security steps based on your assessed risk level
   - The system will show you the security assessment and required factors

## üß™ Testing the AI-MFA System

The project includes several tools for testing the AI-based MFA system:

1. **Demo Script:**
   Run this to visualize different risk scenarios for a user:
   ```bash
   python demo_security_ai.py testuser
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Test:**
   Run this to test all security level transitions:
   ```bash
   python test_mfa.py all
   ```

3. **Test Runner with Instructions:**
   This creates a test user and provides interactive testing instructions:
   ```bash
   python test_run.py
   ```

4. **Unit Tests:**
   Run specific tests for the security level determination:
   ```bash
   python test_security_levels.py
   ```

For detailed testing instructions, refer to the `TESTING_MFA.md` file.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Database Migration Issues
If you encounter database schema errors:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Face Recognition Problems
- Ensure good lighting for face verification
- Position your face clearly in the camera view
- Check that Face-API.js models are properly installed

### Docker Networking Issues
If the Docker container is running but you can't access the app:
```bash
docker logs securechat-container
```

## üîê Security Notes

- Risk factors are weighted to prioritize certain security concerns
- Security level thresholds can be adjusted in security_ai.py
- By default, successful logins update the user's last_login timestamp, reducing future risk scores
- Failed face verification attempts increase a user's risk score for future login attempts
